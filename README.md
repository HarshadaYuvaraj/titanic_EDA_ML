This project predicts the survival of Titanic passengers by implementing machine learning techniques. Exploratory Data Analysis is performed followed by data processing including handling null values, Encoding and outliner removal. 

Various machine learning algorithms were implemented such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes is implemented for a comparative study of the algorithms.
